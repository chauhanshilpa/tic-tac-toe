# tic-tac-toe

tic-tac-toe is a two-player game in which players take turns on a 3x3 grid and can choose pairs of icon to play with. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

I have re-implemented this project in NextJS to showcase my NextJS skills: [tic-tac-toe-next](https://github.com/chauhanshilpa/tic-tac-toe-NextJS)

A separate branch named `with-redux` has been created in this repository for learning purpose and to simplify state management using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
